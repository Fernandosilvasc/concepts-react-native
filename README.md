## :rocket: About the challenge

This challenge is a complement of than two previous challenge that I have done using NodeJS for backend part and ReactJs to frontend. The link to access it will be available below.

challenge 1 : **[GoStack_challenge-concept-nodejs](https://github.com/Fernandosilvasc/gostack_challenge-concept-nodejs)**
challenge 2 : **[Gostack_challenge-concept-reactjs](https://github.com/Fernandosilvasc/gostack_challenge-concept-reactjs)**

In this time basically I create the mobile version using what I have learned in React Native.

The concept the application still the same, the application that will store your portfolio repositories.


### Application Routes

This was requested through that challenge.

- **`List the repositories of your API`**: You should be able to create a list of all the repositories that are registered in your API with the fields **title**, **techs** and number of likes following the pattern `${repository.likes} likes`, just changing the number to be dynamic.

- **`Like one of the repositories retrieve by the API`**: You must be able to give a like to an item in your API through a button with the text **Like** and you must update the number of likes in the listing on the mobile by mutating the state of the application.

### Tests Specification

To complete this challenge was necessary to follow these rules:

- **`should add a like to the like counter of the repository`**: In order for this test to pass, your application must be able to add a like in one of the listed repositories by clicking on the 'Like' button and that update should be viewed on the screen.
